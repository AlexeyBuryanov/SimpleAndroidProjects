### Task
Develop a "Timer" control, which inherits from the finished Android console.
  The timer allows you to set the initial time (hours, minutes and seconds) and ticks every second until the time runs out.
  When time runs out, the timer somehow signals this.
  Methods:
  - setTime
  - start
  - stop
  - pause
  - continue

  Options:
  - delimiter
  - fontSize
